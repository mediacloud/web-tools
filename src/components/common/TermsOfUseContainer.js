    1.  User Agreement\
    
    1.1 Acceptance \
    By clicking on the “I ACCEPT” button during the account registration process, accessing the Platform, or using the Platform, you represent that (i) you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and (ii) you are 13 years or older. If you do not agree to be bound by the Terms of Use or are not at least 13 years of age, you may not register an account or access or use the Platform.\
    
    1.2 Privacy\
    All information collected on or by this Website and Platform is subject to our Privacy Policy. By accepting this Terms of Use, you also consent to the Media Cloud Privacy Policy and all actions taken by us with respect to your information in compliance with the Policy.\
    
    1.3 Changes to the Terms of Use\
    Media Cloud may revise and update these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do so, we will post the revised Terms of Use on this webpage, the revised Privacy Policy at https://mediacloud.org/privacy-policy, send an alert through the platform (e.g. through the “Recent Changes” alert function), and/or send you an email disclosing the changes. Your continued use of the Platform means that you accept and agree to the changes.\
    
    2. Rules of Usage\
    
    2.1 Allowable Uses of the Platform \
    After creating an account, you will be assigned an API key that will give you to access the Media Cloud API, Tools, and User Interface (together referred to as the “Platform”). You may use the Platform for any lawful use, subject to the limitations outlined in these Terms of Use and Section 2.4, and with the knowledge that the Platform is designed for and is best fitted to academic, nonprofit, and journalistic research and not designed for use as a commercial tool for, e.g., market and brand research.\
    
    2.2 Allowable Uses of Platform Outputs and Attribution\
    "Platform Outputs" include aggregated data and/or analyses produced by the Platform (e.g. “number of media mentions in 2019,” “related words in media mentions”) and images generated by the Platform (e.g. charts, “word clouds”). You may use, reproduce, distribute, and/or display any Platform Outputs, including directly copying them.\
    We highly recommend, but do not require, that you attribute Media Cloud when using, reproducing, distributing, and/or displaying any Platform Outputs. We also highly recommend that you attribute Highsoft, the owner of the Highcharts software that we license to generate some of our Platform Outputs. For examples and best practices regarding attribution, see our Attribution webpage. \
    If you choose to attribute to Media Cloud, you may link to the Media Cloud Website homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it. You must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part without our express and written content.\
    
    2.3 Rights to Third-Party Content\
    In contrast to Platform Outputs, which you can use freely, Media Cloud does not own the content (e.g. news stories, blogs) of third-party sources analyzed by or linked to by the Platform. MEDIA CLOUD CANNOT AND DOES NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO USE, REPRODUCE, DISTRIBUTE, AND/OR DISPLAY ANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT. If you choose to use, reproduce, distribute, and/or display that content, you must do so in accordance with the intellectual property rights and/or terms of use of the relevant third-party source(s).\
    
    2.4 Limitations on Use\
    
    ·       You may not use the Platform to infringe on or violate the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, publicity rights or any other rights of any person or entity.
    
    ·       You may not use an unreasonable amount of bandwidth or exceed any API request limit. \
    
    ·       You may not make multiple accounts in order to circumvent the API request limit.\
    
    ·       You may not post material to the Platform that advertises or sells a product or service or functions as spam.\
    
    ·       You may not impede or interfere with others’ use of the Platform, intentionally disrupt, attack, modify, or interfere with the proper working of the Platform in any way, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to Media Cloud’s servers by any means. \
    
    ·       You may not use the Platform in connection with spyware, malware, or other malicious programs or code. \
    
    ·       You may not sell, lease or sublicense the Media Cloud Platform, any Media Cloud API key, or access thereto. \
    \
    
    2.5 Access to the Platform and Website\
    When possible, Media Cloud will try to notify you of any expected restriction of access to or functionality of the Platform and Website. However, we reserve the right to amend or take down the Platform and Website and any service or material we provide on the Platform and Website in our sole discretion with or without notice. From time to time, we may restrict access to all or some parts of the Platform to users, including registered users. Media Cloud will not be liable if all or any part of the Platform or Website is unavailable at any time or for any period.\
    
    2.6 Deletion of User Content and Account\
    Media Cloud has the right, in our sole discretion, to delete any information linked to your account, close your account, and limit or terminate your access to the Platform for violations of this Terms of Use, violations of any other law or public policy, or to protect Media Cloud, MIT, Harvard, or any other entity or individual from liability, including but not limited to copyright liability. \

    4. Ownership of User Content; Responsibility for User Content and Blog Posts
    Media Cloud does not own or seek to own, use, or license any content that you may post or create through the Platform or any Platform Outputs. 
    Media Cloud is not responsible for any user content created through the Platform (e.g. through Public Topics) and has no obligation to pre-screen or monitor content. We do not endorse, support, sanction, encourage, verify, or agree with the comments, opinions, or statements posted or otherwise provided by any Platform user or third-party source. Media Cloud shall have no liability to you or anyone regarding any information or materials posted by Platform users including defamatory, offensive or illicit material, even material that violates this Terms of Use.\
    All statements and/or opinions expressed in the Media Cloud Blog Posts that are signed by individual authors are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the author(s) providing those materials. These materials do not necessarily reflect the opinion of Media Cloud. \
